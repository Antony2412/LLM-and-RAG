Somehow I convinced myself to join this GenAI course that has changed entire career trajectory and perspective on this field and this is all possible with Keerti being so motivating us for learning by attending this 7 weeks live classes and the breadth and depth of concepts grasped in this course is not possible for someone who wants to self-learn. Keerti is very passionate and genuine teacher that reflects in her teaching style and making us understand complex topics effortlessly and she answers our doubts with so much patience which is rare from any instructor.Read moreGowtamy Reddy GodhalaFounding AI/ML EngineerCharter GlobalI’m happy to give this testimonial. Once the trend of AI started, I decided to build everything from scratch in AI. I began with Andrew Ng’s videos on YouTube, which were great, they covered machine learning algorithms well. But then I felt overwhelmed with deep learning. I started looking for simple videos that could help me truly understand deep learning and LLMs. That’s when I came across your YouTube video, Introduction to Machine Learning. I felt so happy and amazed, what took me almost a month to understand about supervised ML algorithms, you explained so clearly in just 23 minutes. After that, I was eagerly waiting for your next ML video. Then I found out that a Generative AI course was coming, and I was super excited and registered immediately. The course went far beyond my expectations. I was truly amazed by the difference before and after the course—I can now understand algorithms, transformer architecture, and ChatGPT in much more depth. And the most enjoyable part? The projects! I still can’t believe we built 10 hands-on projects—wow! I also loved the community this course created. The interactive nature, and the way Amit and the Educosys team responded to questions in the chat, was just amazing. I’d highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to work with LLMs in their workplace. I was especially impressed by how Keerti explained complex architectures in a way that’s easy to understand. She repeated key concepts and made sure everyone was following before moving on. She's such a dedicated teacher, and the whole team was incredibly supportive throughout.Read moreBalaji SriramQA Project ManagerAccion LabsI have been following Keerti’s YouTube videos for quite some time, but I was on a fix about joining the Hands-on Generative AI course. With so much happening in my professional and personal life, I was not sure if I could commit to 7 weeks. Looking back now, I’m so glad I signed up for this course. Many of the topics were new but all the sessions were engaging for me. Attending the live classes every day which has lots of revision and rewatching the recordings really helped me gain confidence. I have already started working on a few projects and that feels amazing to end this year on a positive note. A big thank you to Keerti for designing such a well-structured and inspiring learning experience. It truly made a difference in my AI learning journey. There were multiple revisions after each topic.
